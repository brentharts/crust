"""cs2cpp -- normalise a C# subset into the C++ subset `cpprust.py` reads.

This is the front half of `csrust.py`. It does not emit C. It rewrites C#
source into the subset of C++ that `tools/cpprust.py` already lowers, and
hands that over unchanged. See CSHARP.md for why the split is here rather
than in a shared core: the two languages overlap most in passes that are
already written and already tested (`auto`, range-`for`, namespace
flattening, monomorphisation, vtables), and a textual pipeline cannot be
parameterised over its own grammar.

The load-bearing consequence is diagnostics. A refusal must be reported
*here*, against C# text, in C# terms -- so every construct outside the
subset is checked before a single character is rewritten. Anything that
reaches `cpprust.py` and fails there is a bug in this file, not a user
error, and it says so.

Two rules hold throughout, both inherited from `cpprust.py`:

  * matching runs against a *blanked* copy -- comments, string literals and
    directive lines replaced by spaces of the same length -- so a keyword
    inside `Log("await the result")` asks for nothing;
  * newlines are never added or removed, so a line number in the generated
    C++ is a line number in the original `.cs`.

class ObjectModel(object):
    """How C# reference types are represented in the lowered code.

    The one thing csrust and unity_pack lower differently. csrust's classes
    are owned values, and `null` is C's `NULL`. unity_pack's are indices into
    per-class instance arrays -- the "packed" model -- where a missing object
    is `-1`. unity_pack's own script translator is being moved onto this
    file one family at a time, and each family that depends on the model
    adds what it needs here; `lower_body` is where the families live.

    null_handle -- what `x == null` / `x != null` compares a reference with,
                   or None to leave comparisons to `_lower_literals` (csrust,
                   where a bare `null` is `NULL` everywhere).
    bool_ints   -- `true` / `false` as `1` / `0` (plain C), rather than kept
                   for the C++ subset, which has `bool`.
    this_index  -- the packed receiver: an object *is* its index `i`, so
                   `this.x` is `x` (the implicit-field lowering takes it
                   from there) and a bare `this` is `i`. csrust keeps `this`
                   and lowers `this.` to `this->` itself.
    string_type -- the C type a `string` local is declared as, or None to
                   leave `string` to the type map (csrust: its `string`).
                   The packed engine's is a marker, `_cs_string`, which
                   unity_pack's last pass turns into owned storage (a coost
                   `fastring`) once every other rewrite has read the local
                   as a string.
    byte_array  -- the C struct a `byte[]` is (`ByteArray`, with `.data` and
                   `.length`), or None for the C# subset's own arrays.
    string_plus -- the prefix of the engine's typed concatenation helpers
                   (`_str_plus` -> `_str_plus_i` / `_f` / `_c` / `_s`), or
                   None: `+` on a C string would add to a pointer.
    string_calls -- lowered calls the engine knows return a string: whole
                   calls (`Application_dataPath()`) and call prefixes
                   (`StreamReader_ReadLine(`), for classifying an operand.
    elem_type   -- C# element type -> C++ element type, for `List<T>` and
                   `Dictionary<K, V>`; None keeps the type as written. The
                   packed engine's is unity_pack's (it knows Unity's types),
                   and is lossy: `double` is `float`, every integer `int`.
    map_at_string -- the engine's helper for indexing a map by a string key
                   (a literal or `const char *` has no address to bind), or
                   None.
    field_get, field_set, static_field, at -- how the packed engine spells a
                   field read, a field write, a class's static, and an
                   instance by index: format strings over `cls`, `f`, `r`
                   (the receiver, an index), `v` (a value), `x` (an index).
                   None where fields are C++ members (csrust).
    inst_collection -- where an instance's collection field lives: the
                   packed engine keeps each in a table beside the instance
                   array (`{cls}_{f}[{r}]`), not in the instance's slot.

    anything -- which is why `foreach` over one cannot work: the range-`for`
    lowering needs either a written size or a container with `size()` and

    Spelled `std::vector` on purpose. The prelude is requested either by

    would push every line below it down by one -- which is the one thing
    this file does not do. The `std::` is stripped by the prelude itself a
    few passes later, so nothing downstream sees it.

    Applied repeatedly, innermost-first, so `int[][]` becomes

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# C# calls a type *unmanaged* when it holds no references, all the way
# down: primitives, enums, and structs made only of those. Such a type is
# its bytes, which is what lets `MemoryMarshal` view one as a `byte` span
# without copying or marshalling. A C struct of the same fields is also its
# bytes, laid out by the same natural-alignment rule .NET uses for
# `LayoutKind.Sequential` -- so the lowering is a byte copy, and the bytes
# are the ones .NET would produce on the same machine.
#
# What does *not* carry over is anything with a pointer in it. A `string` or
# an array field is a reference in C# and a heap-owning struct here, and
# copying either as bytes would duplicate an owner. So "is this type
# unmanaged" is checked here, against the C# declarations, and a type that
# is not gets a C# diagnostic naming the field -- which is also what .NET
# does, at compile time for the `unmanaged` constraint.

#: Size of every C# primitive whose size is fixed by the language. `nint`
#: and `nuint` are unmanaged too but are pointer-sized, so they are in the
#: set below and not here: a layout that depends on the target cannot be
#: checked against a `Pack` written for one.

# A `: byte` field that came out four bytes wide would move every field
# after it, which is exactly what a serialised struct cannot afford.
