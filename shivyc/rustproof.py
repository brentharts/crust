"""Lift a Rust function, contracts included, into `hoare.py`'s fragment.

`ilproof.py` lifts a function from the IL, after the front end, and that
reaches Rust only as far as the IL keeps what a proof needs.  For idiomatic
Rust it keeps little: a `match` arrives as a `switch` the lift sees as
`goto`s, a tail `if` expression leaves a dangling return, `&&` is jumps, and
a `u32` is an `int` of no particular width.  This module lifts from the
*source* instead, where all of that is still there, and it reads the
contracts written on the function:

    #[ensures(result <= 23)]
    fn elf_regs_for_class(cls: u32) -> u32 {
        match cls { 0 => 6, 1 => 10, 2 => 15, _ => 23 }
    }

becomes the same fragment `ilproof.py` writes and a person would, with its
postcondition beside it:

    def elf_regs_for_class(cls: 'Nat') -> 'Nat':
        if (cls == 0):
            return 6
        elif (cls == 1):
            ...

    from shivyc.rustproof import lift
    f = lift(source, 'elf_regs_for_class')
    proc = hoare.read_procedure(f.source, env, signatures, f.ensures)

Like `ilproof.py`, it writes source and imports nothing from RosettaMath, so
it costs nothing where there is no kernel, and everything it writes is
checked downstream by a kernel that trusts none of it.

What is claimed, and what is not
--------------------------------
  * Unsigned integers are Nat.  That is exact for `+`, `*`, `/`, `%` and
    comparison until a value passes the type's maximum, and Rust's `-` on
    an unsigned value panics where Nat's truncates at zero.  A theorem about
    the lifted function is a theorem about that model of the arithmetic --
    and what closes the distance is the *safety* lift (`Lifted.safety`):
    every place the Rust would panic becomes a claim of its own, with the
    type's width still in hand.  `a + b` owes `a + b <= u32::MAX`, `a - b`
    owes `b <= a`, `a / b` owes `b != 0`, `xs[i]` owes `i < len(xs)`, and a
    call owes its callee's `#[requires]`.  Signed integers are refused.

  * Slices (`&[u64]`, `&Vec<u32>`) are the fragment's `Array`, and a struct
    declared in the file is a record.  A function taking one `&mut` struct
    and returning `()` lifts to one *returning* the struct -- the state
    threading `hoare.py` does for a syscall -- and in its `ensures` the
    parameter is the final value, `old(..)` the one it came in with.

  * `#[requires]` becomes the fragment's leading `assert`s, `#[ensures]` its
    postconditions, and `#[invariant]`/`#[variant]` on a `while` its loop
    annotations -- the same clauses Crust checks at runtime.  In an
    `ensures`, a parameter means its value at entry, which is what `old(x)`
    says; a clause naming a `mut` parameter without `old` is refused rather
    than read one way or the other.

  * The lift refuses rather than approximates, naming the construct:
    references, fields, methods, indexing, signed or float types, `loop`,
    `break`, macros and recursion all come back as a `LiftError`.  The
    refusals are the roadmap.

`tests/test_rustproof.py` checks the lift the way `test_ilproof.py` checks
its own: each function is compiled by Crust and run, and the lifted term is
evaluated through the kernel on the same inputs.
